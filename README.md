# ACM-tasks-Laasya-Chaithanya-This repositry consits of 3 tasks
Task 1: Unsupervised Learning Model on a Dataset (Clustering)
DataSet used: Iris data set.
The goal of this task is to apply an unsupervised learning algorithm, specifically K-Means Clustering, on a dataset and evaluate its performance using clustering metrics.
Task 2: Classifier or Regressor from Scratch and Compare with Standard Libraries
DataSet used:California housing dataset
This task involves building a machine learning Classifier (or Regressor) from scratch, comparing its performance with that of a model built using standard machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn.
Task 3: Basic Deep Learning Network for Binary Classification
Dataset used:  Breast Cancer Dataset
In this task, the goal is to implement a simple Deep Learning Network using TensorFlow or PyTorch to perform a binary classification task.
